Android app to try out [location API](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/location/strategies.html). I had hopes of working out a cheap way to do really accurate location for surveying using two devices. However test results are disappointing. These two screen dumps are from a Moto G and a Nexus 7 running this app sitting side by side on a picnic bench. The only thing they agree on is the OS 6 figure reference. Perhaps if you had two identical devices it might be possible to get better results.
